    <p class="statement">
        Welcome to my portfolio! This page will document all of my classwork throughout the semester
        as we learn to navigate different types of coding. Here, I will have a record of my improvement as
        I get more comfortable with each project. My goal is to create a page that not only showcases my 
        work, but is easy to navigate and pleasing to look at (I have a long way to go in terms of aesthetics).
